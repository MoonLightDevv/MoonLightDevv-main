## 🛠️ What I Do

I maintain and distribute Hypixel Skyblock Forge clients, including builds originally made for supporters.  
All clients are cleaned, updated, and focused on useful automation, ESPs, dungeon tools, and QoL features.

No locked menus. No launchers. No paywalls.

## 🔓 Clients I Maintain

| Client                    | Description                                                               |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pizza Client**           | QoL client with fake-rotation auras, macros, nukers, and dungeon ESPs     |
| **Pizza Client Supporter** | Full supporter version — includes all features previously locked          |
| **Oringo Client**          | Skyblock skill macros, slayer tools, dungeon helpers, and visual modules  |
| **Oringo Client Supporter**| Enhanced edition with extra helpers, early-access modules, and polish      |
| **Cheeto Client**          | ESP-heavy Forge mod with stealth patches, mod ID hider, and dungeon tools |
| **Funnymap Extras**        | Supporter build of Funnymap with improved overlays and secret detection    |

All are built for **Forge 1.8.9**, optimized for Hypixel Skyblock.

- Client cleanup, testing, and release management  
- Unlocking and improving supporter-only features  
- Maintaining changelogs, docs, and full releases  
- Delivering builds with **no spyware, bloat, or obfuscation**
